## Maintaining and patching an older release line

It may be necessary to patch a prior release line of a plugin when users depend on an older, but stable version and while a newer, incompatible, major version of the plugin exists. Typically for these older releases, only major bugs and security issues will need to be remediated. Not every plugin will need this workflow.

This guide will describe the steps needed to release on an older version.

### Patching an older release

When patching an older release, follow the steps below to ensure the correct workflow is applied:

1. Request a `workspace/${workspace}` branch:
    - Ensure a branch with the name `workspace/${workspace}` exists and has appropriate branch protections in place. This branch will be used to handle patch releases.
    - The `${workspace}` should correspond to the specific plugin or component you are patching.

2. Reset the `workspace` branch:
    - Reset the `workspace/${workspace}` branch to the version of the plugin you need to patch.
    - You can use the autogenerated tags from previous releases to pinpoint the specific point in history to apply the patch.

3. Apply your commits:
    - Apply the necessary patch fixes or security updates.
    - Manually bump the `package.json` version to reflect the new patch version (e.g., from `1.2.3` to `1.2.4`).

4. Run the release workflow:
    - Navigate to the GitHub Actions tab in your repository and manually trigger the release workflow.
    - When prompted, specify your `workspace` (which will automatically infer the `workspace/${workspace}` branch based on the naming convention).
    - Select the option `force release with no changesets`.
    - The workflow will now run, building and releasing the patched version.
